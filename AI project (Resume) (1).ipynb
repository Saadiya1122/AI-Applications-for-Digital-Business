    "\n",
    "In this digital era, the recruiting process has changed rapidly by technology being used to optimise and increase the number of employment/hiring processes.\n",
    "The goal of this project is to improve the hiring process by creating a machine learning algorithm that can parse resumes in different formats and automating the comparison process which might be helpful for the recruiters to determine whether a candidate’s qualification and job criteria aligns. \n",
    "The Resume Parsing AI project uses modern methods like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the analysis of data from resumes. The ultimate goal is to provide hiring managers and recruiters with a simpler accurate, and efficient way of finding top talent and making accurate recruiting decisions.\n"

    "The Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure is calculated in this code to evaluate how well a resume scoring system performs for different job descriptions. The process begins by starting a TF-IDF vectorize it converts textual data into feature vectors. Next, it concatenates the \"Description\" and \"Requirements\" columns of job descriptions and vectorizes both the job descriptions and manually uploaded resumes. Next it uses cosine similarity scores the resumes get scored for each job description. The 50 rated resumes and the manually labelled relevant resumes are then compared to get the MAP scores for each job description. The manually labelled resumes act as the real-world data it showes which resumes are considered useful or appropriate for each job description as the system creates a list of the top 50 resumes based on similarity scores. Finally the calculation and display the total MAP score which is the average performance over all job descriptions. It helps by showing the algorithm's capacity to properly rank resumes compared to some job descriptions."

The fine_tune_word2vec_model() method is then used to improve the model on the given job description text, improving its analysis of language specific to the job. Next using cosine similarity scores calculated by using the rank_resumes() function, resumes are sorted on how well they match the job description. Thus to help recruiters or employers find the best applicants for a certain job opening the sorted resumes are finally displayed. By using Word2Vec's capacity to store semantic connections between words, this integrated method improves the application and precision of job hiring processes.\n",
